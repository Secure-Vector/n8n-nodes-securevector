**AI prompt security scanning for n8n workflows.** Detect prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, and 17+ threat categories in real-time.

> **⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER**: This software is provided "AS-IS" without warranties. SecureVector makes NO guarantees about security effectiveness. Users assume ALL risk and liability. See [License](#license) for full terms.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Via n8n Community Nodes** (Recommended):
1. Go to **Settings** → **Community Nodes** → **Install**
2. Enter: `@securevector/n8n-nodes-securevector`
3. Restart n8n

**Via npm**:
```bash
cd ~/.n8n && npm install @securevector/n8n-nodes-securevector
```

### Setup

<p align="center"><img src="docs/architecture.png" alt="n8n workflow → SecureVector node → Cloud or Local App" width="100%"></p>

The node supports **two transports**, chosen per-node via the `Transport` field:

| | **Cloud** (default) | **Local App** |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | `scan.securevector.io` | `http://127.0.0.1:8741` (your machine) |
| Signup / API key | Required (`sv_xxxxx`) | None — runs on your laptop |
| Available operations | `Scan Prompt` only | All v0.2.0 operations (scan, tool audit, cost tracking, budget, device ID) |
| **Pros** | ML-driven analysis (Llama Guard + Bedrock Claude), continuously-updated threat-intel rule library, team alerts via Slack / email / webhooks, custom AI-generated rules tuned to your industry | Runs **100% on your machine** — prompts never leave your network. Tamper-evident hash chain. Free, open-source, no signup. |
| **Best for** | Production workflows where you want SOC-grade detection + team notifications | Indie devs, regulated industries, anyone who wants prompts to stay local |

You can mix transports across nodes in the same workflow — e.g., scan with Cloud (better detection), audit + cost-track with Local App.

<img src="docs/cloud-setup-badge.svg" alt="Cloud setup" height="32">

1. **Get an API key** — [open the dashboard](https://app.securevector.io/dashboard?section=access) (or navigate: SecureVector App → Access Management → Create API Key). Format: `sv_xxxxx`.
2. Add the SecureVector node to your workflow.
3. Leave **Transport = Cloud** (default) and configure the credential.

---

<img src="docs/local-app-setup-badge.svg" alt="Local App setup" height="32">

Install + run the local app on your machine:

```bash
pip install securevector-ai-monitor[app]
securevector-app --web
```

Then add the SecureVector node to your workflow and set **Transport = Local App**. No credential needed.

---

## Local App — v0.2.0 operations

All operations below are **local-only** — they require Transport = Local App and depend on machine-local state (hash chain, per-user cost history, device identity).

| Operation | Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt → Scan Prompt** | `POST /analyze` | Same as cloud — scan a user prompt. |
| **Prompt → Scan Output** | `POST /analyze` (llm_response=true) | Scan an LLM response for PII / secret / leakage. |
| **Tools → Check Permission** | `GET /api/tool-permissions/essential` + `/custom` | Ask the app whether a tool call is allowed, blocked, or log-only. |
| **Tools → Log Call** | `POST /api/tool-permissions/call-audit` | Append a tamper-evident audit row. |
| **Tools → Verify Chain** | `GET /api/tool-permissions/call-audit/integrity` | Walk the hash chain, return `{ok, total, tampered_at}`. |
| **Costs → Check Budget** | `GET /api/costs/budget-status` | Today's spend vs configured budget. |
| **Costs → Track** | `POST /api/costs/track` | Record one LLM call's token usage. |
| **System → Get Device ID** | `GET /api/system/device-id` | Stable per-machine identifier (for fleet attribution). |

### Canonical workflow patterns

<p align="center"><img src="docs/use-cases.png" alt="Two example n8n workflows showing where SecureVector nodes plug in: A) simple LLM workflow with SV nodes inline; B) AI Agent with SecureVectorPolicyTool wrapping each real tool" width="100%"></p>

The diagram above shows the two canonical patterns. **Panel A** is the simple message-path pattern — drop SV nodes inline between a trigger, an LLM node, and a respond node. **Panel B** is the AI-Agent pattern — `SecureVectorPolicyTool` sub-nodes wrap each real tool so the agent can't bypass the policy pre-check.

**Static LLM workflow — cost-gated content generation:**

```
[Schedule hourly]
  → [SV Check Budget, agent_id=content-bot]
    → IF over_budget = true → [Slack alert] → stop
    → else                  → [OpenAI Message-a-Model, Simplify Output: OFF]
                               → [SV Track Cost, source=openai_native,
                                     input_tokens = {{$json.usage.prompt_tokens}},
                                     output_tokens = {{$json.usage.completion_tokens}}]
                               → [Publish to CMS]
```

**Static tool-gating — customer-support chatbot with injection protection:**

```
[Webhook]
  → [SV Scan Prompt, Block on Threat: ON]
    → allow → [OpenAI] → [SV Scan Output, Block on Threat: ON]
                           → allow → [Respond to Webhook]
                           → block → [Respond with fallback] + [SV Log Call action=block]
    → block → [Respond with polite refusal]
```

**AI Agent tool-gating — see SecureVectorPolicyTool below.**

### Token paths vary by upstream LLM node

The SecureVector app never counts tokens itself — it reads what the provider already returned. The `source` dropdown on `Costs → Track` tells the node where to read from:

| Upstream node | Source | Reads from |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI "Message a Model" (core) | `openai_native` | `$json.usage.prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` (Simplify Output OFF) |
| LangChain Chat Model attached to a Basic LLM Chain | `langchain_chain` | `$json.response.generations[0][0].generationInfo.tokenUsage.{promptTokens, completionTokens}` |
| AI Agent (Tools Agent) | `agent_execution` | `Get Execution` API fallback — the AI Agent node does not expose tokens in `$json` ([long-standing n8n issue](https://community.n8n.io/t/retrieve-llm-token-usage-in-ai-agents/68714)) |

### SecureVectorPolicyTool — gating AI Agent tools

A second node class ships in this package: **SecureVector Policy Tool**. It's a **tool sub-node** (not an action node) that attaches to an AI Agent like any other tool. It wraps a user-supplied sub-workflow with a built-in SecureVector policy check.

#### Prerequisite — configure tool permissions in the SecureVector app first

Before the Policy Tool does anything useful, you need to define which tools are allowed / blocked / log-only **in the SecureVector app itself**. The app's `/tool-permissions` page is the source of truth — the n8n Policy Tool just reads from it at runtime.

1. Open the SecureVector app at <http://localhost:8741> and go to **Tool Permissions**.
2. For each tool you'll wrap with a Policy Tool node, set its action: `allow`, `block`, or `log_only`. Use the existing essential tools list (Gmail.send, HTTP.request, etc.) or add custom tools via **+ Add Custom Tool**.
3. Note the `tool_id` (e.g., `Gmail.send`, `HTTP.request`) — that's what you'll paste into the Policy Tool node.

The Policy Tool reads `/api/tool-permissions/essential` + `/api/tool-permissions/custom` on every invocation (with a 10-second client-side cache), so changes you make in the app's UI take effect within 10 seconds in n8n — no node restart required.

#### End-to-end setup (do this in order)

**Step 1 — In the SecureVector app:** open <http://localhost:8741> → **Tool Permissions** → set each tool's action to `allow`, `block`, or `log_only`. Note the `tool_id` for each (e.g., `Gmail.send`, `HTTP.request`).

**Step 2 — In n8n:** point your workflow at the local app's tool-permissions endpoints by adding `SecureVector Policy Tool` sub-nodes to your AI Agent. Set each sub-node's `Tool ID` to the value from step 1. The Policy Tool reads `GET /api/tool-permissions/essential` + `GET /api/tool-permissions/custom` at runtime — no extra config needed beyond `Transport = Local App`.

**Step 3 — Build the wrapped sub-workflow:** for each tool, create a separate n8n workflow that starts with an `Execute Workflow` trigger and contains the real action (Gmail Send, HTTP Request, Slack, etc.). Paste that workflow's ID into the Policy Tool's `Real Target Workflow ID` field.

#### Workflow shape

```
Main workflow:
  [Trigger] → [AI Agent (Tools Agent)]
                ← Chat Model                    (OpenAI / Anthropic sub-node)
                ← Memory                        (Window Buffer)
                ← SecureVector Policy Tool      (tool_id=Gmail.send,
                                                 real workflow id=1234)
                ← SecureVector Policy Tool      (tool_id=HTTP.request, …)

Workflow 1234 ("real Gmail send"):
  [Execute Workflow trigger with args] → [Gmail Send node]
```

#### Runtime behavior

When the AI Agent's LLM picks the `secure_gmail_send` tool, the Policy Tool internally:

1. Calls `GET /api/tool-permissions/essential` + `GET /api/tool-permissions/custom` and looks up the configured `tool_id` (cached for 10 seconds across nodes in the same workflow run).
2. If `action=allow` or `log_only`, invokes the real sub-workflow with the LLM's args.
3. If `action=block`, returns `{blocked: true, reason}` to the Agent — the real workflow never runs.
4. Either way, writes an audit row to the tamper-evident chain via `POST /api/tool-permissions/call-audit`.

**Why this pattern:** the n8n AI Agent has no native pre-tool hook and prompt-engineering "always call checkPermission first" is unreliable (LLMs skip long instructions). Wrapping each sensitive tool in a sub-workflow means the LLM physically cannot invoke the real Gmail Send node — enforcement is runtime, not advisory.

**Tool description for the LLM:** the `Tool Description` field on the Policy Tool is what the LLM reads as the tool spec. Write it imperative + name the real target + mention the block branch:

> *"Send an email via Gmail. Returns `{blocked: true, reason}` when SecureVector policy denies the call."*

so the agent handles block gracefully.

## Data Privacy

**What data is sent to SecureVector API?**

This node sends **ONLY** the following data to the SecureVector API for analysis:

1. **Input data** - Any content you provide in the `prompt` parameter (text, prompts, data, or any other input you want analyzed)
2. **Metadata** (optional) - Only if `includeMetadata` is enabled:
   - Workflow ID
   - Execution ID
   - Source identifier (`n8n-workflow`)

**Why is this data sent and stored?**

- **Analysis**: Your input is analyzed for security threats and returned with a threat score
- **Your auditing**: All data you send is **persisted for your own logging and auditing purposes** - this allows you to review scan history, track which workflows triggered scans, and maintain audit trails

**What is NOT sent?**

- API keys or credentials
- Other node data or variables not explicitly provided
- Workflow configuration or logic
- Any data from other nodes in your workflow

**Important**: Anything you send for analysis will be stored by SecureVector for your auditing and logging purposes. Only send data you consent to being analyzed and stored.

**Data retention**: See [SecureVector Privacy Policy](https://securevector.io/privacypolicy) for details on how scan data is stored and retained.

## Security Notes

### Development Dependencies
`npm audit` may show a critical vulnerability in `form-data` (via `n8n-workflow`). **This does not affect the published package** because:

- `n8n-workflow` is a **peer dependency** (provided by n8n runtime, not bundled)
- Our package only bundles `zod` (no vulnerabilities)
- Our code uses **JSON requests**, not multipart/form-data
- The vulnerability would need to be fixed in n8n core, not this package

For the latest security updates, keep your n8n installation up to date.

### Reporting Security Issues
